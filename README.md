# BayesianABM
This is a Bayesian Agent-Based Model of persuasive argument exchange. Relationships between arguments are represented using Bayesian networks.

BNcode.R contains the code for generating random Bayes nets and performing exact inferences over them.
It is leveraged by the agent-based model in BayesianABM_Hidden_Profile.nlogo.
With this model we generate complex hidden profiles and simulate group deliberation with different communications strategies, e.g. advocacy of own opinion, conformity with majority opinion, and random.
